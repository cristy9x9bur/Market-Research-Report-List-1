<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hollow-carrier Perforating Guns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>WCP Type</li><li>TCP Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hollow-carrier perforating guns are categorized into two main types: WCP (Wireline Conveyed Perforating) and TCP (Tubing Conveyed Perforating). WCP involves delivering the guns via wireline, allowing for precise placement and deployment in wells, making it suitable for low-pressure, shallow formations. Conversely, TCP deploys guns through production tubing, offering enhanced efficiency and the ability to penetrate high-pressure environments, making it ideal for deeper wells where greater perforation effectiveness is required. Both types play vital roles in optimizing oil and gas extraction.</p></p>
