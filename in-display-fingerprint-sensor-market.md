<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The In-Display Fingerprint Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Optical In-Display Fingerprint Sensor</li><li>Ultrasonic In-Display Fingerprint Sensor</li><li>Capacitive In-Display Fingerprint Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The in-display fingerprint sensor market features three primary types: Optical, Ultrasonic, and Capacitive sensors. Optical in-display sensors use light to capture fingerprint images through the display, making them cost-effective but less secure. Ultrasonic sensors utilize sound waves to create a 3D map of the fingerprint, offering enhanced accuracy and security. Capacitive sensors detect changes in capacitance when a finger touches the screen, providing reliable performance, though they are typically more complex and expensive. Each type balances cost, security, and performance differently.</p></p>
