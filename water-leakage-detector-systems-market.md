<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Leakage Detector Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positioning Water Leakage Detector Systems</li><li>Non-positioning Water Leakage Detector Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water leakage detector systems are categorized into two main types: positioning and non-positioning. Positioning water leakage detector systems utilize advanced technologies to accurately locate the source of a leak, often incorporating sensors and real-time monitoring capabilities. In contrast, non-positioning systems primarily detect leaks without providing specific location details, relying on alarms or alerts to notify users of a problem. Both types serve critical roles in preventing water damage, enhancing maintenance efficiency, and protecting property in residential and commercial settings.</p></p>
